										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the year 2020, technology is everywhere. Every digital device around the world is connected by a singular network where data travels. Unbeknownst to humans, this network has become home to life forms known as &quot;Digimon.&quot;</p>
<p>Fifth-grader Taichi Yagami is preparing for summer camp when strange occurrences begin in Tokyo; certain electronic systems have started going haywire. When he discovers that his sister and mother are trapped on an unstoppable train, he rushes to the nearby station. Suddenly, Taichi is transported to another world where he meets a strange creature by the name of Agumon, who somehow already knows his name. Taichi also receives a strange device called a &quot;Digivice,&quot; which allows him to communicate with the undigitized world.</p>
<p>Taichi discovers he is in the &quot;Network,&quot; and virus-like Digimon are attacking the areas that maintain Tokyo&rsquo;s electronic systems. It is up to Taichi and his new partner Agumon to stop these cyberattacks before the whole world is threatened by the actions of mischievous Digimon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago, there was a valiant swordsman who came to be known simply as &quot;the hero.&quot; There was a demon who has caused people suffering. The hero and his companions arrived to challenge the demon to a battle and by combining their powers, the battle was brought swift conclusion. With no one around to cause trouble, the island became a quiet place where everyone could live together in peace.</p>
<p>Several years later, the demon is revived. Our present-day protagonist, Dai, lives on a remote island in the southern seas and dreams of becoming a great hero. When he hears about the demon&#039;s revival, Dai and his friends take it upon themselves to stop him and the evil force that revived him. Along the way, Dai discovers the identity of &quot;the hero,&quot; the truth behind the evil force who revived the demon, and Dai&#039;s own hidden powers that surface in times of peril.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gol D. Roger was known as the &quot;Pirate King,&quot; the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece&mdash;which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame&mdash;and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.</p>
<p>Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy&rsquo;s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes&mdash;One Piece.</p>
