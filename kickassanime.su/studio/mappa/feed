										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Denji has a simple dream&mdash;to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji&#039;s dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.</p>

Bring armed forces, wisdom, politics, conspiracy, whatever you can use! No-rule &amp; no-limit three-way battle royale is about to begin!!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoumen Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna&#039;s body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the undead!</p>
<p>Yuuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they&#039;ll unleash when they break the seal&#8230; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violent misfortunes frequently occur around 16-year-old Yuuta Okkotsu, a timid victim of high school bullying. Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta&#039;s curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him.</p>
<p>Yuuta&#039;s unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Gojou sees immense potential in Yuuta, and he hopes to help the boy channel his deadly burden into a force for good. Yet Yuuta struggles to find his place among his talented classmates: the selectively mute Toge Inumaki, weapons expert Maki Zenin, and Panda.</p>
<p>Yuuta clumsily utilizes Rika on missions with the other first-year students, but the grisly aftermath of Rika&#039;s tremendous displays of power draws the interest of the calculating curse user Suguru Getou. As Getou strives to claim Rika&#039;s strength and use it to eliminate all non-jujutsu users from the world, Yuuta fights alongside his friends to stop the genocidal plot.</p>
