Along the way, she would meet all kinds of people, from a country full of witches to a giant in love with his own muscles&mdash;but with each meeting, Elaina would become a small part of their story, and her own world would get a little bit bigger. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hero of Tensei shitara Ken deshita differs from your standard otherworldly protagonist in that he is reincarnated as a sword! Beginning his quest by spawning in the middle of a beast-ridden forest, he encounters an injured girl frantically fleeing for her life. Saving her from her assailants, the pair acquaint themselves, and the girl introduces herself as Fran. She bears a heavy past, having endured the enslavement and maltreatment of her tribe, the Black Cats.</p>
<p>As the hero is unable to remember the name from his past life, the young and tenacious Fran bestows him the name &quot;Shishou&quot; and becomes his wielder. Thereafter, Shishou and Fran become a formidable team, embarking on quests to liberate the oppressed and exact justice! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fantasy centers around Makoto Misumi, an ordinary high school boy summoned to an alternate world as a brave warrior. Unfortunately, the goddess of the world said with disdain, &quot;Your face is ugly,&quot; stripped him of his title, and banished him to the outermost fringes of the wilderness.</p>
<p>While wandering the wilderness, Makoto encountered dragons, spiders, orcs, dwarves, and all sorts of other non-human species. Due to differences in the environment from his home world, Makoto now exhibits extraordinary powers in magic and combat. Thus, he survives in this world while dealing with various encounters. The curtain rises on the alternate-world social reform fantasy of a boy forsaken by gods and humans.</p>
