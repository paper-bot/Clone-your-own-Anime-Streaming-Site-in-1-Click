										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryou Mizushima enrolls in junior high and joins the badminton club with great vigor. Although the club didn&#039;t have a proper coach, Mizushima improved his skills with his own physical strength by the time he participated in the prefectural tournament. Afterwards, he is approached by the Yokohama Minato High School&#039;s badminton coach, Ebihara.</p>
<p>Indecisive and timid, Mizushima hesitates to attend such a prestigious school. However, with his elder sister Rika giving him a strong push, he decides to go to Yokohama Minato. Now blessed with a coach and idiosyncratic teammates, Mizushima will gain experience he&#039;s lacked till now, and aims to win the inter-high tournament.</p>
