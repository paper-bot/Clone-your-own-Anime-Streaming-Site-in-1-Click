										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vampires are said to have many weaknesses such as garlic, crosses, and sunlight. Game-loving vampire lord Draluc just so happens to be weak to&#8230; everything. He dies, turning into a pile of ash, at the slightest shock.</p>
<p>After Vampire Hunter Ronaldo learned of a castle inhabited by a vampire rumoured to have kidnapped a kid, he went there intending to take the devil down. However, the vampire turned out to be Draluc, a wimp who keeps turning into ash at the smallest things. Moreover, the kid wasn&#039;t being held captive&mdash;he was just using the &quot;haunted house&quot; as his personal playground!</p>
<p>When his castle is destroyed, Draluc moves into Ronaldo&#039;s office, much to the other&#039;s chagrin. Despite their differences, they must try to work together to defend themselves from rogue vampires, Ronaldo&#039;s murderous editor, investigators, and more&mdash;with Draluc dying continuously along the way. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For as long as she could read, Eliana Bernstein&mdash;more commonly known as the &quot;Bibliophile Princess&quot;&mdash;has preferred the company of books to that of people. However, as a noble, it is her duty to find a suitor. Fortunately for her, Crown Prince Christopher Selkirk Asherald proposes a deal: He will protect her free time, and, in exchange, Eliana will be his fianc&eacute;e in name only.</p>
<p>The years they spend together are bliss, as Eliana learns to open herself to others. But all good things must come to an end. For Eliana, who loves books more than people, ending their fake relationship should be no big deal. But as Christopher grows close with another girl, Eliana begins to realize that she isn&#039;t as indifferent to him as she once thought. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the story of the anime, one day a black meteorite fell on the world, and the world completely changed. The meteorite produced grotesque monsters called D2, which started running rampant. D2 very quickly banned all music, which was the one thing able to overcome them. But there were some people who resisted the D2. They are young women who hold the power of music, the &quot;Musicart.&quot; These young women hold &quot;scores&quot; that are able to defeat the monsters. And there are also people who lead these women, the Conductor.</p>
<p>The anime takes place in America in the year 2047, which has fallen to ruin thanks to the D2. Takt, a Conductor, is partnered with a Musicart named Unmei. Takt yeans for music to be returned to the world, and Unmei wishes to destroy the D2. Their aim is to travel to New York.</p>
