										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Director! Please help us bloom!&quot;</p>
<p>In Tokyo, there is a place called Velude Way. It is a district notorious for its performers and theatrical groups. Izumi Tachibana, who was previously a stage actress, arrives with a letter that reads, &quot;Full of debt! Zero customers! Only one actor!&quot; It describes the current state of the once-popular theater group Mankai Company. Her task is to rebuild the company to its former glory as the new owner and chief director.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring 1999.</p>
<p>Admiring and wanting to be a cute maid, a young girl comes to Akihabara. The end-of-the-century &quot;Akiba&quot; is filled with a wide variety of maids. The maid cafe &quot;Ton Tokoton,&quot; commonly known as &quot;Butagoya&quot; (Pig Hut), is open today as well!</p>
<p>I was in a panic because the new maid who had joined the store with me was quite unpredictable. Maids, trainers, and other Akihabara life forms appear as well, and the red bat swings into action!</p>
<p>This is a full-fledged maid&#039;s work struggle diary, given to all masters and ladies. &quot;We are waiting for you to come home, boo.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of the last summer vacation of high school, Youta Narukami spends his days preparing for the university entrance exams, when a young girl named Hina suddenly appears, proclaiming herself as the &quot;god of omniscience.&quot; Youta is confused and does not believe Hina when she tells him &quot;The world will end in 30 days.&quot; After witnessing Hina&#039;s God-like predictive ability, Youta begins to believe her powers are real. Hina, who is innocent and childlike despite her supernatural powers, decides for some reason to stay at Youta&#039;s home. Thus begins the start of their lively summer before the end of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world&#8230; and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo! Can even a brilliant strategist like Kongming adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people?! </p>
