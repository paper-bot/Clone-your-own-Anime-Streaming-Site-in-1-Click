										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hisoka was an orphan who was raised by Yukitaka, the present head of the worldwide Jinsei Corporation, with the help of his right-hand man Daisuke. He was adopted for the sole purpose of working both publicly and secretly for his daughter Orihime, who was next in line to inherit the business. That&rsquo;s why he did not hesitate when he was asked by Yukitaka to attend the same school as her and serve as her bodyguard in secret.</p>
<p>The only problem was that her school was the refined Saint Ceral Girls&rsquo; Academy, which was closed to boys. He didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but it would be a major turning point in his life. </p>
