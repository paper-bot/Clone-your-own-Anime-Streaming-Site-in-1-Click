<p>&quot;This time I will beat him. So come at me again&#8230; accept! &#039;Bloom, gambler of souls!&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>In New Kyoto, a city governed by the &quot;King,&quot; one&#039;s worth is determined by his or her strength in the Build Divide trading card game. Rumors swirl about New Kyoto and its King.</p>
<p>&quot;If you defeat the King in Build Divide, any wish will be fulfilled.&quot; And in order to challenge the King, one must participate in the TCG battle known as Rebuild, and the &quot;Key&quot; must be completed.</p>
<p>Everyone has a wish they long to have fulfilled. Teruto Kurabe, a boy who vows to take down the King, and Sakura Banka, the mysterious girl who guides him, throw themselves into the Rebuild battle. With New Kyoto as the stage, the curtain rises and the battle begins for Teruto and his friends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alcohol, smoking, and stress&mdash;in the body subjected to these irritants, the cells responsible for maintaining life seem to fight a war that never ends. Due to a severe shortage of workers, Red Blood Cell AA2153 has to quickly learn to deliver oxygen and collect carbon dioxide, even in dangerous conditions. Meanwhile, White Blood Cell U-1196 has to do her part by dealing with germs and viruses during life-threatening situations. In the midst of these crises, they have to work together to keep the body healthy, despite not knowing if their sacrifices will be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Hataraku Saibou Black takes a different approach by showing the grittier side of the jobs our cells perform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once, the land of Togenkyo was a peaceful land, where humans and yokai lived together. Then, however, men appeared who tried to revive Gyumaoh, the Great Yokai who was slain by the war god Nataku Taishi and buried in Houtou Castle 500 years ago, by using a forbidden combination of chemistry and magic</p>
<p>The negative energy waves this created spread across Togenkyo, causing the yokai to go insane and attack humanity. To save the land, Kanzeon bosatsu orders Son Goku, Genjyo Sazno, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai to go west. The four set out on a journey to stop the experiment to revive Gyumaoh.</p>
<p>On the way, they meet Hazel Grouse, who employs strange magic that uses yokai souls to revive the dead, and his follower Gato. The two of them join the party. And Ukoku Sanzo, a man they have a long history with, approaches in the shadows&#8230;</p>
<p>Unforgettable characters, intense personal drama, and awesome action in a story about the bonds between four men!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With no soccer accomplishments to speak of during the entirety of Sumire Suou&#039;s junior high school years, the young wing gets an odd offer. Suou&#039;s main rival, Midori Soshizaki, invites her to join up on the same team in high school, with a promise that she&#039;ll never let Suou &quot;play alone.&quot; It&#039;s an earnest offer, but the question is whether Suou will take her up on it. Thus the curtain opens on a story that collects an enormous cast of individual soccer-playing personalities! </p>

One day, Faria, a successor of the Seven Knights, saves an ordinary boy named Nemo from the forces of Destruction.</p>
<p>During the ensuing battle, Nemo summons the power of a hero and becomes a successor as well. However, Nemo&#039;s hero is a stranger that is unknown to history, and so an epic journey where the past and present collide begins. </p>
