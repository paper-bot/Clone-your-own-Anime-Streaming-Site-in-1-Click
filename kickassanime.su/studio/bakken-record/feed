										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Set in alternate history Japan in 1931 and the 64th year of the Meiji era, the Tokugawa shogunate was never abolished and Emperor Meiji was never restored to power. The anime will follow the activities of &quot;Nue,&quot; an organization of shogunate executioners who enforce the government. The country has developed its own energy source, the &quot;dragon vein,&quot; and has achieved a unique development in which science and the Edo period are mixed.</p>
<p>However, behind the glamorous city, the dissident organization Kuchinawa strives to overthrow the administration, while the Nue of the Tokugawa regime, who was entrusted with its extermination, are in conflict. Sawa Yukimura, whose family was killed when she was young, continues to search for Janome, the executioner of the Nue.</p>

<p>The series was streamed one week in advance of Japan&#039;s broadcast beginning on March 31, 2021 on Hulu. Regular TV broadcast began on April 7, 2021.</p>
