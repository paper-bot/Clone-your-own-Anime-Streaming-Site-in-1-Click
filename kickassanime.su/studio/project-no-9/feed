										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office worker Yoshida has been crushing on his coworker, Airi Gotou, for five years. Despite finally scoring a date with her, his confession is promptly rejected. Drunk and disappointed, he stumbles home, only to find a high school girl sitting on the side of the road. The girl, needing a place to stay the night, attempts to seduce Yoshida. Despite rejecting her advances, he nevertheless invites her into his apartment.</p>
<p>The next morning, the girl, introducing herself as Sayu Ogiwara, reveals that she has run away from Hokkaido all the way to Tokyo. During her six-month spree, she continually traded sexual favors for a roof over her head. Yoshida, however, remains unswayed by her seduction. Instead, he has her do a different kind of work&mdash;one that entails washing dishes and doing laundry. And so, a touching relationship between a heartbroken adult and a runaway high school girl begins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomozaki is one of the best gamers in Japan, and in his opinion, the game of real life is one of the worst. No clear-cut rules for success, horribly balanced, and nothing makes sense. But then he meets a gamer who&#039;s just as good as him, and she offers to teach him a few exploits&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the eyes of the public, Fudou Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are sworn enemies who have nothing in common. Fudou, also known as &quot;Red Gelato,&quot; is the leader of the hero squadron &quot;Gelato 5,&quot; whose mission is to bring about world peace. On the other hand, Desumi is the minion leader of &quot;Gecko,&quot; a villainous organization seeking world domination. However, despite these differences, their relationship is not quite what it seems. When they are not making a show of being at each other&#039;s throats, Desumi and Fudou continue to pursue a forbidden love.</p>
<p>Going on dates, baking sweets for one another, and meeting up as often as they can despite their hectic schedules, the two inexperienced lovebirds pave the way for their own unique relationship. Though their public lives are worlds apart, Fudou and Desumi will stop at nothing to make their seemingly impossible romance work. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A certain boy and girl in middle school became lovers, flirted with each other, disagreed on trivial things, became more frequently irritated with each other rather than excited&#8230; and ended up breaking up at graduation. And so the two of them, Mizuto Irido and Yume Ayai, wound up meeting each other in the most unexpected fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#039;t it obvious that I&#039;m the elder brother?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#039;t it obvious that I&#039;m the elder sister?&quot;</p>
<p>The children of the partner of their parents&#039; remarriage were ex-lovers?!</p>
<p>The former couple, mindful of their parent&#039;s feelings, decided on a &quot;sibling rule&quot; where the one who becomes conscious of the other as the opposite sex loses, but&#8230; When they encounter each other in the bathroom, commute to and from school together&#8230; along with the memories of the past and living under the same roof, just how do they disregard each other?! </p>
