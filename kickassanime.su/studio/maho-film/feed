										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yotsuya Yuusuke along with his classmates Shindou Iu and Hakozaki Kusue have been transported to a strange and unknown world inhabited by mythological creatures. As soon as they arrive, they meet somebody calling himself the Game Master who then grants them a time-limited quest. To aid them in this quest, he also bestows Shindou and Hakozaki with the roles of a Magician and a Warrior while Yotsuya is randomly granted the role of&#8230; a Farmer?!</p>
<p>This is how a hectic life of adventuring began for three students who now have no choice, but to complete random quests for several phases in the fantasy world if they want to stay alive and protect the real world from the demons and monsters they encounter. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being acutely ill, a young girl has spent most of her life in a hospital room playing otome games to fill her time. However, she one day finds herself in the midst of a scene from one of these games as the story&#039;s villainess, Irene Loren D&#039;Autriche.</p>
<p>At the banquet to celebrate the end of the academy&#039;s winter term, the crown prince and Irene&#039;s childhood friend, Cedric Jeanne Elmeier, publicly annuls his engagement with Irene and announces that he is in love with Lilia Rainworth, the game&#039;s female protagonist. Aware of the tragic future ahead of her and determined to change it, the young girl resolves to conquer the game&#039;s final boss, the &quot;Demon King&quot; and Cedric&#039;s half-brother, Claude Jeanne Elmeier, by making him fall in love with her instead.</p>
<p>With time running out, can Irene succeed with her plans, or will she remain bound to the ill-fated ending that awaits her? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryouma Takebayashi dies in his sleep at the age of 39 after leading a life of misfortune. Taking pity on him, three deities offer him the chance to reincarnate in a world of magic where he has only one mission: to be himself and enjoy life. They bestow upon Ryouma powerful physical abilities as well as the affinity to master all elements, and promise to watch over him. His new life as a young child officially starts when he is teleported into a forest.</p>
<p>Three years go by. Having spent most of his time researching slimes, Ryouma has managed to evolve unique kinds of slimes, training an army of them while developing his magic abilities. Although the young boy is happy with his hermit existence and comfortable cave home, he somewhat misses the company of humans. But after healing an injured member of a passing group of travelers from a duke&#039;s household, Ryouma is persuaded to go with them and exit the forest accompanied by his menagerie of slimes. A whole new world awaits him, where his skills as a magic user and slime tamer continue to elicit surprise and admiration. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Beginnings in Familiar Lands.</p>
<p>After a horrific accident put her on life support, the last vestige of freedom Keina Kagami had was in the VRMMORPG World of Leadale. When she wakes up in the body of her game avatar, though, Keina&mdash;now Cayna&mdash;finds that the worries of her old life appear to be a thing of the past, but somehow this new land doesn&#039;t seem to be quite the Leadale she remembers&#8230;</p>
