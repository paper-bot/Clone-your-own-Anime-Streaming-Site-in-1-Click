										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifteen-year-old Yuna prefers staying home and obsessively playing her favorite VRMMO to doing anything else, including going to school. When a strange new update gives her a one-of-a-kind bear outfit that comes with overpowered abilities, Yuna is torn: the outfit is unbearably cute, but too embarrassing to wear in-game. But then she suddenly finds herself transported into the world of the game, facing down monsters and magic for real, and the bear suit becomes the best weapon she has! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beast Tamer Rein, who uses animals, was a member of the hero&#039;s party. However, since he couldn&#039;t do anything else, he wasn&#039;t able to keep up in battle.</p>
<p>&quot;You only know how to play with animals. You&#039;re fired.&quot;</p>
<p>Rein is kicked out of the party and now lives freely as an adventurer. On his journey, he meets a girl from a cat tribe, the so-called strongest species. Elsewhere, the hero&#039;s party remains unaware that their previous success was all thanks to Rein&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the story of a beast tamer no longer held back and his fateful encounter with a precious companion.</p>
