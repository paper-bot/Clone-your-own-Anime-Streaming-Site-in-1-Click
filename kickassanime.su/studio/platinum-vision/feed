										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As long as hearts exist inside people, there will always be those who suffer. And then something &quot;strange&quot; enters their mind and causes a strange disease to manifest itself in the body. The illness, which is called a &quot;mystery disease&quot; is unknown to most, but certainly exists. There is a doctor and apprentice who fights the disease, which modern medicine cannot cure.</p>
<p>His name is Ramune. He acts freely all the time, is foul-mouthed, and doesn&#039;t even look like a doctor! However, once he is confronted with the mysterious disease, he is able to quickly uncover the root cause of his patients&#039; deep-seated distress and cure them. And beyond that&#8230; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The silent and stoic Chateau Dankworth is a bounty hunter. Her target: Son Ryang-ha, a notorious killer known for killing 18 high-class officials in a single night. To this day, his murders remain swift, efficient, and bloody. However, after Son Ryang-ha overpowers Chateau in their first encounter, he reveals his own intentions: he too is after her, aiming for her heart.</p>
<p>Son Ryang-ha&#039;s attempts to catch her eye are quite unique, to say the least. He offers gifts to her in the form of her current targets, tied up and battered, and will do anything to spend more time together. Reluctantly, Chateau goes along with this act, and so begins the cat-and-mouse game of love between two killers.</p>
