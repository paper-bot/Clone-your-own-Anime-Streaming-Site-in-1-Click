<p>But when a rising tide of violence results in Makoto losing a loved one, can he ride out the storm, or will he drown in all the spilled blood that floods his streets?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sshhh! Princess Syalis is trying to get a good night&#039;s sleep. Some shut-eye. Forty winks. Catch some Z&#039;s. Long ago in olden times when people and demons lived together in&mdash;well, disharmony, really&mdash;a demon king kidnaps a human princess and imprisons her in his castle. Bereft, the princess&#039;s subjects beat their chests in anguish&#8230;until a hero arises to spearhead Project Rescue Our Princess! While waiting for her knight in shining armor, what&#039;s an imprisoned princess to do&#8230;? Teddy-bear guards with bat wings are all very well, but her dungeon cell is bo-o-o-ring! So, she decides to wile away the long hours by sleeping. Now if only she could get comfortable&#8230;and didn&#039;t suffer from insomnia&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My childhood friend Shida Kuroha seems to have feelings for me. She lives next door, and is small and cute. With an outgoing character, she&#039;s the caring Onee-san type, this being one of her greatest strengths.</p>
<p>&#8230;But, I already have my first love, the beautiful idol of our school, and the award-winning author, Kachi Shirokusa! Thinking about it rationally, I should have no chances with her, but, while walking home from school, she only talks to me, with a smile even! I might actually have a chance, don&#039;t you think?!</p>
<p>Or so I thought, but then I heard that Shirokusa already has a boyfriend, and my life took a turn for the worse. I want to die. Why is it not me?! Even though she was my first love&#8230; As I was drowning in despair and depression, Kuroha whispered.</p>
<p>&mdash;If it&#039;s that tough for you, then how about we get revenge? The best revenge ever, that is~ </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Held every summer, the national show &quot;Selection Project&quot; is the biggest gateway for girls who strive to be idols, and the place where the legendary idol Akari Amazawa was born. Suzune Miyama is also one who has longed for such a dream stage. Having been sick since childhood, she listened to the song of the light many times in her bed in the hospital room. Akari&#039;s singing voice gave her a lot of smiles and courage, inspiring Suzune to follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>In her last summer of junior high school, Suzune decides to challenge the 7th annual Selection Project to make her dream come true. The girls who challenge Selection all have strong feelings that are second to none, accumulated efforts, and extraordinary charm. Only nine stars are selected from among the thousands of candidates. Now, the hot and harsh &quot;Audition Battle&quot; of the<br />
girls begins to make their dreams come true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Igarashi Futuba&#039;s new job would be great if her senpai, Takeda Harumi, wasn&#039;t so incredibly annoying! Futuba hates his laugh, she hates how big he is, and she really hates that he treats her like a little kid. Just because Futuba is short and looks young doesn&#039;t make her a kid, and just because she spends so much time with Takeda doesn&#039;t mean she sees him as anything but an annoying senpai&#8230;or does she?! </p>
