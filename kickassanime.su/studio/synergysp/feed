										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Meguro River Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised&#8230;who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamahiko Shima is the youngest son of the powerful and wealthy Shima family. Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.</p>
<p>After losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and is cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family&#039;s name, he resigned himself to dying alone&mdash;until one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko&#039;s father sent her to be his bride.</p>
<p>As she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko&#039;s dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.</p>
