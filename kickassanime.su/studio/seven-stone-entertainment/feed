										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of the 21st century, the discovery of a new energy source called &quot;DG energy&quot; (short for &quot;divine grace energy&quot;) has revolutionized Earth&#039;s economy and allowed humanity to colonize space. However, when the initial expedition reaches Pluto, they are attacked by a mysterious, giant life-form known as &quot;Nergal.&quot;</p>
<p>The Earth Alliance Army fights back by creating an &quot;AG Unit&quot; using ancient robot weapons known as the &quot;G&#039;s Frame&quot; which were excavated from archaeological sites all around the world. Girls with special qualities known as &quot;Ancient Girls&quot; can pilot these robots against the Nergal. However, the first AG Unit suffers heavy casualties in the Jupiter Trojan campaign, and the pilot of Unit 04, Minamiya Reiu, goes missing-in-action&#8230;</p>
<p>Years later, Minamiya Reika, the younger sister of Reiu, enlists with the AG Unit to search for her sister and to protect the Earth from the Nergal. A story of friendship, ancient robot weapons, and battles to the death with the Nergal ensues.</p>
