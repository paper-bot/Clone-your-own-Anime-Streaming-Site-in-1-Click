										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day, college student Yuuhi Amamiya is approached by talking lizard Sir Noi Crezant. Crezant immediately launches into a fantastical story: the powerful mage Animus intends to destroy the earth with his biscuit hammer, a huge contraption looming high in earth&#039;s orbit. Earth&#039;s only hope lies with the princess and her Beast Knights, whose task is to protect the princess and defeat Animus.</p>
<p>Yuuhi is chosen as the Lizard Beast Knight, and despite his misgivings, is quickly forced to defend himself from a golem created by the mage. He is saved by his neighbor, the princess Asahina Samidare, and swears loyalty to her. However, the princess does not intend to save the earth at all. She lets Yuuhi in on her real motivations: to prevent Animus from destroying the earth, only to then annihilate the planet by her own hand. The pair continue to fight off attacks by Animus&#039;s golems while the remaining Beast Knights are slowly being gathered and learning to use their powers. But Yuuhi will have to decide for himself whether to go along with Asahina&#039;s plans, whom he is getting close to, or to save the earth. In the process, he must also confront his true self, and determine where his loyalties truly lie. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lucius Modestus, an ancient Roman architect, finds himself job-hunting due to having trouble coming up with new ideas. As his demeanor and personality become dismal, his friends try taking him to a bathhouse for him to relax. Unable to unwind in the bustling and crowded bath, Lucius dips his head in the water. Down there, he finds a secret tunnel that transports him to a modern-day Japanese bathhouse, providing him the inspiration he needed to make a new creation.</p>
<p>Loaded with what seems to be knowledge way ahead of his time, Lucius does his best to try and recreate his findings, usually inferior in quality due to his circumstances. However, the sheer ingenuity may be just enough to gain the attention of the citizens and regain his reputation as an architect. </p>
