										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#039;s Shouko Komi&#039;s first day at the prestigious Itan Private High School, and she has already risen to the status of the school&#039;s Madonna. With long black hair and a tall, graceful appearance, she captures the attention of anyone who comes across her. There&#039;s just one problem though&mdash;despite her popularity, Shouko is terrible at communicating with others.</p>
<p>Hitohito Tadano is your average high school boy. With his life motto of &quot;read the situation and make sure to stay away from trouble,&quot; he quickly finds that sitting next to Shouko has made him the enemy of everyone in his class! One day, knocked out by accident, Hitohito later wakes up to the sound of Shouko&#039;s &quot;meow.&quot; He lies that he heard nothing, causing Shouko to run away. But before she can escape, Hitohito surmises that Shouko is not able to talk to others easily&mdash;in fact, she has never been able to make a single friend. Hitohito resolves to help Shouko with her goal of making one hundred friends so that she can overcome her communication disorder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After recovering from the inner struggles he faced in the past, Daigo Shigeno continues to play baseball and is now the captain of Fuurin Private Academy Middle School&#039;s baseball team. Alongside Mutsuko Sakura, his classmate from elementary school, he aims to lead the team to glory. However, due to unexpected circumstances, Fuurin&#039;s baseball team is left with only six members: Daigo, Mutsuko, Yayoi Sawa, Tao Sagara, Seira Kandori, and Hiromu Tanba. Left with mostly female players and lacking in experience, the team struggles to gain confidence and trust from the new recruits&mdash;Akira Nishina, Anita Kabashima, and Chisato Fujii. Facing challenges such as having no proper coach, problematic recruits, and a limited number of members, Daigo&#039;s resolution is put to the test as he tries to bring the team together in time to participate in their first ever tournament.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The franchise&#039;s story centers on wizards who gather mazica in order to save the world. Junior high school student Kezuru wakes up after a strange dream featuring himself as a wizard, a creature called &quot;mazin,&quot; and a mysterious girl. The next day, his friend Kuracchi proudly shows off the newly launched Mazica Party card game. To Kezuru&#039;s shock, all the characters drawn in the game&#039;s cards are just like the ones in his dream.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kezuru receives a notification for an event at the major international company Mazica. Intrigued, Kezuru goes to the Mazica Store as directed, only to meet the Mazica CEO himself, Jeff Johns. Johns says, &quot;I have great expectations for you,&quot; and hands Kezuru Mazica Gear.</p>
<p>On his way back home, Kezuru is attacked by an airship-like creature. Just when he thinks, &quot;this is it!&quot; to himself, his Mazica Gear erupts and a magic book appears. When he scratches a card, he seals a contract with Barunya, a &quot;mazin&quot; creature that is an odd remixed fusion between an airship and a cat.</p>
<p>The mysterious girl Anya says Kezuru and those of his ilk will be &quot;the true wizards who save the world.&quot; Amid all these mysterious revelations, Kezuru enrolls in the Mazica Academy and engages in Mazica Party card battles alongside his partner mazin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ordinary town, there are people who live a peaceful and fulfilling life. But they don&#039;t know that it is a false peace. The untold truth&#8230; The earth has already been destroyed&#8230;</p>
<p>99.9% of the human race has been wiped out by a mysterious alien force from outer space. The enemy is named &quot;Dracters.&quot; Eventually, a large hole was drilled in the earth and terraformed into a suitable environment for the aliens to live. Humans have no choice but to hide in shelters to escape their eyes. Waiting for the day of resurrection, which they do not know when it will come&#8230;</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the shelter Ixia have had their memories of the day of destruction erased, and live a normal life without knowing anything about it. However, some of them, the &quot;chosen ones,&quot; have become pilots, driving giant robots called &quot;Rogue&quot; and fighting against aliens. Today, another new pilot is selected&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a city which should be familiar, there is the feeling of something a little different.</p>
<p>Kotokawa is a taxi driver who lives an ordinary life, taxing some quirky customers around. A slightly eccentric stranger who has no relatives nor any relations with other people, Kotokawa&#039;s hobby is to listen to Rakugo on the radio before going to bed. For the time being, the only people he can consider as friends are his family doctor Gouriki, and his high school classmate Kakihana.</p>
<p>Kabasawa, a college student who wants a buzz, Shirakawa, a nurse who&#039;s hiding something, comedian group Homo Sapiens, who isn&#039;t selling well, the city hoodlum Dobu, and the rookie idol group Mystery Kiss&mdash;the conversations with these people, which should not have meant much, lead to a girl who disappeared.</p>
