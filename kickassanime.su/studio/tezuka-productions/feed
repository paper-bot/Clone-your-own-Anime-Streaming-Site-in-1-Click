										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second floor of the gym―this was where we always met. It was class time, but of course, there weren&#039;t any classes going on in a place like this.</p>
<p>This was where Shimamura and I became friends. We hung out here―talking about TV shows and cooking, playing some ping pong&#8230; This is where we fostered our friendship.</p>
<p>Keeping my head propped against the wall, I let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>What was this feeling? Yesterday, I&#039;d dreamt of me and Shimamura kissing.</p>
<p>Not that I&#039;m like that. I&#039;m sure Shimamura isn&#039;t either. It&#039;s not even something worth repeating myself about, but really, it&#039;s not like that.</p>
<p>It&#039;s just that when she hears the word &quot;friend,&quot; I want her to think of me first. That&#039;s all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After harboring an unrequited love for years, Naoya Mukai finally gets to date his childhood friend, Saki Saki. However, just as he tries to commit himself to this relationship, he receives an abrupt confession from Nagisa Minase.</p>
<p>At first, Naoya tries to reject her but is soon overcome by feelings of not wanting to hurt Nagisa. Trying to avoid betraying his girlfriend&#039;s trust in him, Naoya thinks up a &quot;solution&quot; to make both girls happy&mdash;two-timing. Naturally, Saki rebuffs this idea, but through Naoya&#039;s and Nagisa&#039;s persistence, she reluctantly submits.</p>
<p>With this, a three-way affair begins between Naoya, his girlfriend, and his &quot;other&quot; girlfriend, as they develop a relationship that deviates from the social norm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war that raged between the Church and the Witches for five centuries finally ended in peace but a few short years ago. However, nestled in the shadowy places of the world, the embers of that age old conflict still smolder.</p>
<p>Attending the Royal Academy of Magic of the Kingdom of Wenias is a struggling student named Sable, who has no memories of his time before being enrolled. At the command of Headmaster Albus, he left the Kingdom to travel to the southern reaches of the continent, where anti-magic insurgents are still a force to be reckoned with, as part of a special training regimen. Accompanying him are a party of individuals strong in both ability and personality; there&#039;s the one known as the Witch of the Dawn, Roux Cristasse, who seeks the forbidden knowledge of primeval magic in the &quot;Grimoire of Zero,&quot; the genius girl Holtz, as well as the school&#039;s sole beast, Kudd.</p>
<p>Just what truth shall they uncover in their journey to the south&#8230;?</p>
