										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shinichi Kudou, a high school student of astounding talent in detective work, is well known for having solved several challenging cases. One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child.</p>
<p>Perfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.</p>
<p>Detective Conan follows Shinichi who, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri&#039;s cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug&#039;s effects someday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His name is Lupin III. He is a gentleman thief whose grandfather was the renowned phantom thief Ars&egrave;ne Lupin.</p>
<p>When it comes to the art of thievery, there is nothing Lupin III cannot steal; whether it be jewels, works of art, hidden treasures, the secret to immortality, or the heart of a pretty girl.</p>
<p>Lupin&#039;s partners are Daisuke Jigen, a great gunman; Goemon Ishikawa, a master swordsman; Fujiko Mine, a devilishly clever femme fatale. There is Inspector Zenigata, a relentless ICPO officer, consumed with an obsessive desire to apprehend the masterful thief. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amakawa Haruto is a young man who died before reuniting with his childhood friend who disappeared five years ago. Rio is a boy living in the slums who wants revenge for his mother who was murdered in front of him when he was five years old.</p>
<p>Earth and another world. Two people with completely different backgrounds and values. For some reason, the memories and personality of Haruto who should&#039;ve died is resurrected in Rio&#039;s body. As the two are confused over their memories and personalities fusing together, Rio decides to live in this new world.</p>
<p>Along with Haruto&#039;s memories, Rio awakens an unknown &quot;special power,&quot; and it seems that if he uses it well, he can live a better life. But before that, Rio encounters a kidnapping that turns out to be of a princess of the Bertram Kingdom that he lives in.</p>
<p>After saving the princess, Rio is given a scholarship at the Royal Academy, a school for the rich and powerful. Being a poor orphan in a school of nobles turns out to be an extremely detestable place to be.</p>
