										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mars Red takes place in 1923, and vampires have existed for quite a while. But now, the number of vampires is increasing and a mysterious, artificial blood source called Ascra has appeared.</p>
<p>The Japanese government, in turn, creates &quot;Code Zero,&quot; an unit within the army tasked with taking down the vampiric forces. And what better way to track vampires than by using vampires?</p>
<p>Created by Lieutenant General Nakajima, this unit has historically been in the business of information war, but has been re-assigned to solve the vampire crisis. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the death of his parents, a young Mirai Kakehashi is left in the care of his abusive relatives. Since then, he has become gloomy and depressed, leading him to attempt suicide on the evening of his middle school graduation. Mirai, however, is saved by a pure white girl named Nasse who introduces herself as a guardian angel wishing to give him happiness&mdash;by granting him supernatural powers and a chance to become the new God.</p>
<p>In order to earn the position, he must defeat 12 other &quot;God Candidates&quot; within 999 days. Soon, Mirai begins a struggle to survive as a terrifying battle royale erupts between himself and the candidates looking to obtain the most power in the world.</p>
