										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beautiful maid Lilith has recently been hired to care for the whims of her employer&#039;s son, Yuuri. However, Yuuri&#039;s overzealous skepticism of her every action keeps him on edge as he suspects devious mischief being plotted behind his back. Despite his paranoia, Lilith grows fond of Yuuri and often teases him as a way to further their bonding.</p>
<p>Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii revolves around the relationship between the cautious Yuuri and his wonderfully charming maid in this day-to-day oddball romantic comedy. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the most powerful entity of all time, the Demon Lord Varvatos thinks life is a big fat snore. When he takes matters into his own hands and decides to reincarnate, he calibrates his magical strength to be perfectly average. But there is no way he could have predicted that everyone in the modern world would be weak as hell, which means he is totally overpowered once again! Reborn under the name Ard, he has ladies fawning over him, the royal family begging him to become the next king, and an ex-minion insisting on killing him?! But Ard has a one-track mind, and he won&#039;t stop at anything to achieve his ultimate goal!</p>
