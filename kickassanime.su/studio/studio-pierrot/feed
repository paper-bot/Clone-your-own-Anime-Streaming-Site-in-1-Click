										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came to know of the &quot;Wizard King&quot;&mdash;a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom&mdash;and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.</p>
<p>When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno&#039;s Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno&#039;s voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a &quot;Black Clover&quot; giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal&mdash;to become the Wizard King!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the successful end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Konohagakure has been enjoying a period of peace, prosperity, and extraordinary technological advancement. This is all due to the efforts of the Allied Shinobi Forces and the village&#039;s Seventh Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki. Now resembling a modern metropolis, Konohagakure has changed, particularly the life of a shinobi. Under the watchful eye of Naruto and his old comrades, a new generation of shinobi has stepped up to learn the ways of the ninja.</p>
<p>Boruto Uzumaki is often the center of attention as the son of the Seventh Hokage. Despite having inherited Naruto&#039;s boisterous and stubborn demeanor, Boruto is considered a prodigy and is able to unleash his potential with the help of supportive friends and family. Unfortunately, this has only worsened his arrogance and his desire to surpass Naruto which, along with his father&#039;s busy lifestyle, has strained their relationship. However, a sinister force brewing within the village may threaten Boruto&#039;s carefree life.</p>
<p>New friends and familiar faces join Boruto as a new story begins in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.</p>
