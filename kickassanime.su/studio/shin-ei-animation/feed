										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Meguro River Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised&#8230;who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shamisen is a traditional Japanese musical instrument that looks similar to a guitar. Teenager Sawamura Setsu&#039;s grandfather who raised him and his older brother Wakana, recently passed away. His grandfather was one of the greatest Shamisen players and the two siblings grew up listening to him play and learning to play the instrument.</p>
<p>Since their grandfather&#039;s death, Setsu dropped out of high school, moved to Tokyo and has been drifting, not knowing what to do besides play his Shamisen. That&#039;s when his successful and rich mother, Umeko, storms into his life and tries to shape Setsu up. She enrolls him back into high school, but little does Setsu know that he is about to rediscover his passion for Shamisen. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neku Sakuraba, a 15-year-old boy with a hobby for music and graffiti, wakes up in what seems to be the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan. With no idea why he&#039;s there, he opens his hand to realize he is holding a strange black pin. After flipping it with his hand, the thoughts of the people surrounding him begins to flow into his head at once. Surprised, Neku discovers he is able to read the minds of others and assumes it has something to do with the black pin he is holding.</p>
<p>A cell phone starts to ring in his pocket, and he can&#039;t tell whether it is his or not. A text message appears: &quot;Reach 104. You have 60 minutes. Fail, and face erasure. -The Reapers.&quot; After discovering he can&#039;t delete the message, a timer of 60 minutes imprints onto his right hand. Neku is in Shibuya to play the &quot;Reapers&#039; Game,&quot; which spans a total of seven days. All Players of the Reapers&#039; Game have a black pin with a skull embedded on it.</p>
